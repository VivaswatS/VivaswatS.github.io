## Going through Katie's comments
* talk to whomever you like for department highlights
* adjust mission statement to make it explicit that part of the goal is to improve people's writing
* compiling a list of journal clubs/book clubs/discussion groups

## Website or Digital Issue?

Should set up a website with a couple tabs with who we are, who to contact, and links to issues
* check to see how much a domain name costs
  * quick search suggests as low as $5

## Content
* no limit on length for the first issue--just feel it out
* the past and upcoming events sections should be short blurbs at most
* highlight a handful of speakers (whomever wants to write someone up), and do a list of the rest
* add a segment for scicomm/outreach etc
##### Longer form submissions
These are in the original notes
* book review
* organism highlight
* conservation
* method or technique

## Deadlines
* editing as things come in
  * multiple editing or group editing
