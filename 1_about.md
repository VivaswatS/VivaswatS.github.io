__Attn: I am currently looking for bioinformatics or computational/statistical biology/genomics positions post-PhD (~summer 2025). Please get in touch if you know of any relevant positions by emailing me [here](mailto:vivaswat@uchicago.edu)!__

I am a fifth year (time flies!) PhD student in the [Committee on Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu) at The University of Chicago, studying population genetics. I am fascinated by the biological variation present around us, and am interested in developing novel computational and statistical techniques to understand the forces shaping this variation. 

Outside of school, I enjoy meeting new people and making them laugh. I also enjoy thinking about how the world is shaped and seeing how common patterns emerge across vastly different societies. On days when I'm blessed by the _Divine Providence_, I also enjoy putting these thoughts into writing. 

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wyoming in 2017, where I worked on parallelizing computer vision algorithms for NVIDIA GPUs. Right after, I joined the [Buerkle lab](https://uwyo.edu/buerkle) to pursue my Master's in Botany, where I worked on extending a genotype and ancestry estimation model for mixed-ploidy species using genotype-likelihoods.
