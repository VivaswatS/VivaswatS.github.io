I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Stephen Wright](http://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca).
I started in September 2015 and am currently working on a few projects related to the causes, patterns, and consequences of changes in positive and negative selection following transitions in mating system and ploidy in Brassicaceae species.  

I received my B.S. in Genetics and Genomics with a minor in Statistics from the University of California, Davis in 2015.
There I worked in the [Ross-Ibarra lab](http://www.rilab.org) contributing to research on genome size evolution, [scripts](https://github.com/mojaveazure/angsd-wrapper) to improve population genomic software, and crop-wild introgression in *Oryza*.
