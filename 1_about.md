I'm currently a third year PhD student in the [Committee on Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu) at The University of Chicago, studying population genetics. I am fascinated by the biological variation present around us, and am interested in using novel computational and statistical techniques to understand the forces shaping this variation. Outside of school, I enjoy making people laugh and playing football (the *real* kind).  

I received my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computational Science from the University of Wyoming in 2017, where I worked on parallelizing computer vision algorithms for NVIDIA GPUs. Right after, I joined the [Buerkle lab](https://uwyo.edu/buerkle) to pursue my Master's in Botany, where I worked on extending a genotype and ancestry estimation model for mixed-ploidy species using genotype-likelihoods.
